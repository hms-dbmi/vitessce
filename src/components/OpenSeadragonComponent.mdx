# OpenSeadragonComponent

A wrapper around [OpenSeadragon](https://openseadragon.github.io/).
The normal UI controls are hidden and the viewport is controlled by the React props instead.

<Playground>
  <div style={{width: '200px', height: '150px'}}>
    <OpenSeadragonComponent
      tileSources={[
        "https://libimages1.princeton.edu/loris/pudl0001%2F4609321%2Fs42%2F00000001.jp2/info.json"
      ]}
      sample={4}
      x={14000}
      y={23000}
      width={8000}
      height={6000}
    />
  </div>
</Playground>

The component will fill the full height and width of its parent,
so something like the parent `<div>` is necessary.
The `tileSources` prop is passed through to OpenSeadragon,
so any supported format can also be handled here.
The `sample` prop scales the other coordinates:
It is useful if the image has been down-sampled,
but you would still like `x`, `y`, `width`, and `height`
to reference the original coordinate system.
