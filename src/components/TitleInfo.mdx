# TitleInfo

This component is used for all panes in the app.
Bootstrap styles (not present here) are necessary for it to look right.
Drag-and-drop and resizing depend on the particular class names,
but none of the actual logic is here.

<Playground>
  <TitleInfo
    title="Your title"
    info="Your info"
  >
    Your content here.
  </TitleInfo>
