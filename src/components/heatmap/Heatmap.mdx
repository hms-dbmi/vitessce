# Heatmap

A basic cell-by-gene heatmap.

<Playground>
  <div style={{
    width: '400px',
    height: '100px',
    flex: '1 1 auto',
    display: 'flex',
    flexDirection: 'column'
  }}>
    <Heatmap
      cellColors={ cellColors }
      selectedCellIds={ selectedCellIds }
      clusters={{
        rows: rows,
        cols: cols,
        matrix: matrix
      }}
    />
  </div>
</Playground>

The overall size and layout of the heatmap is set by the containing element.

Three props are required: `clusters`, `selectedCellIds`, and `cellColors`.

The `clusters` prop in turn has three properties:
  - `rows`, a list of row IDs,
  - `cols`, a list of column IDs,
  - `matrix`, a list of row values, with each value between 0 and 1.

The `selectedCellIds` prop is an object: Keys are column IDs,
and if the value is true, it is regarded as selected.

The `cellColors` prop is an object: Keys are column IDs,
and values are RGB triples, with each value between 0 and 255.
These colors might represent categories or continuous values.
