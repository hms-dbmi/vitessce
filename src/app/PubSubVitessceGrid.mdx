# PubSubVitessceGrid

Provides the complete, multi-panel application as a single React component.

```
<PubSubVitessceGrid
  config={{
    name: 'Demo',
    layers: [
      {
        name: 'fake'
        type: 'FAKE'
        url: 'http://example.com/fake'
      }
    ]
    staticLayout: [
      {
        component: 'X',
        props: {
          cells: { ... },
        },
        x: 0, y: 0, w: 2, h: 2
      },
      ...
    ]
  }}
  getComponent={(name) => {
    const registry = {
      X: XComponent,
      Y: YComponent
    };
    return registry[name];
  }}
/>
```

The `config` prop includes `layers` which define the data sources,
and either a `staticLayout` or `responsiveLayout`.

The `getComponent` prop is a function which maps from names to actual React Components.

For more information, see the examples, and the JSON schemas.
