# Getting Started

Vitessce ("Visual Integration Tool for Exploration of Spatial Single-Cell Experiments")
is both an app, and set of reusable React components.
In like manner, this documentation is addressed both to developers of the app,
and to others who just want to reuse components.

- Vitessce developers should begin with the [README](https://github.com/hms-dbmi/vitessce#readme),
and then find the sections here which are useful.
- Outside developers can jump straight to the "Published Components".

## Architecture

[<img alt="Component diagram" src="https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vSoB3YGPxOTKnFOpYHeHX4JruHnibGXruM36uAZtuvPQNM3a7F4uS3q4b5jwGNQ6TJ7bQ9IPB32rdle/pub?w=650"/>](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1vS6wP1vs5QepLhXGDRww7LR505HJ-aIqnGn9O19f6xg/edit)

- List of data sets is hardcoded in `app.js`...
some day, we'll have a real API to pull this from.
- [`vitessce-data`](https://github.com/hms-dbmi/vitessce-data) puts files on S3, and `LayerManagerPublisher` pulls them down and checks that they conform to schema.
- Rather than being a single React app, each component is independent,
with communication facilitated by [PubSubJS](https://github.com/mroderick/PubSubJS#readme).
  - `Publisher`/`Subscriber` are only useful with the particular event system we are using...
  - but the wrapped components can be reused in other React apps.
- The overall window layout is managed by `VitessceGrid` (using [react-grid-layout](https://github.com/STRML/react-grid-layout#readme)),
  - and this is not coupled to the components it contains
- In the `Spatial` component different visualization technologies are positioned on top each other.
  - [DeckGL](http://deck.gl/) handles vector data.
  - [OpenSeadragon](https://openseadragon.github.io/) provides the background imagery.
