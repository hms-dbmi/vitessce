# Getting Started

Vitessce ("Visual Integration Tool for Exploration of Spatial Single-Cell Experiments")
is both an app, and set of reusable React components.

- Everyone: Check out the [demo](../index.html)!
- Vitessce developers: Begin with the [README](https://github.com/hms-dbmi/vitessce#readme)
for an overview of our development process.
- Outside developers: Jump straight to the "Published Components".

## Architecture

[<img alt="Component diagram" src="https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vSoB3YGPxOTKnFOpYHeHX4JruHnibGXruM36uAZtuvPQNM3a7F4uS3q4b5jwGNQ6TJ7bQ9IPB32rdle/pub?w=650"/>](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1vS6wP1vs5QepLhXGDRww7LR505HJ-aIqnGn9O19f6xg/edit)

- List of data sets is hardcoded in `app.js`...
some day, we'll have a real API to pull this from.
- [`vitessce-data`](https://github.com/hms-dbmi/vitessce-data) puts files on S3, and `LayerManagerPublisher` pulls them down and checks that they conform to schema.
- Rather than being a single React app, each component is independent,
with communication facilitated by [PubSubJS](https://github.com/mroderick/PubSubJS#readme).
  - `Publisher`/`Subscriber` are only useful with the particular event system we are using...
  - but the wrapped components can be reused in other React apps.
- The overall window layout is managed by `VitessceGrid` (using [react-grid-layout](https://github.com/STRML/react-grid-layout#readme)),
  - and this is not coupled to the components it contains
- In the `Spatial` component different visualization technologies are positioned on top each other.
  - [DeckGL](http://deck.gl/) handles vector data.
  - [OpenSeadragon](https://openseadragon.github.io/) provides the background imagery.
