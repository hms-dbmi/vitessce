## Demo

Input data is provided (for now) by a drag and drop interface.
You can download small sample [input files](https://github.com/hms-dbmi/vitessce-data/tree/master/fake-files/output-expected),
or you can checkout and run [`vitessce-data`](https://github.com/hms-dbmi/vitessce-data)
to generate a full data set.

Then visit our [live demo](https://hms-dbmi.github.io/vitessce/) and add your data.

## Development

Checkout the project, `cd`, and then:

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

The development server will refresh the browser as you edit the code.
