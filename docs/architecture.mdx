- List of data sets is hardcoded in `app.js`.
- [`vitessce-data`](https://github.com/hms-dbmi/vitessce-data) puts files on S3, and `LayerManagerPublisher` pulls them down and checks that they conform to schema.
- Rather than being a single React app, each component is independent, with communication facilitated by PubSubJS.
- `Publisher`/`Subscriber` components could be reused in a separate application which would use the same PubSubJS events...
- or the wrapped components could be reused in other React apps.
