### Added
- Linked hover effect between spatial, scatterplot, and heatmap.

## [0.0.15](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vitessce/v/0.0.15) - 2019-06-07
### Added
- The `<TitleInfo>` component now takes children, and our JSX is tidier.
- Using [docz](https://www.docz.site/) for documentation, and add to the push script.
- Each JSON schema now checks that we are getting all and only the expected fields...
and we have a sort-of schema for the schema to make sure these checks are in place.
- Handle arbitrary mappings, not just t-SNE. Now computing PCA in vitessce-data.
- Flexible configuration: load components by name, or have multiple instances
of the same type of component.
- Half-baked proof-of-concept integration with HiGlass.
- Separate registry that holds Name -> Component mappings.
- Easy deployment to vitessce.io.
- Friendlier error page on AWS deployment.
- Display current version info in deployed demo.
- Can now specify the URL of a JSON config to load.
### Changed
- Make Heatmap more usable as a standalone.
- Fix (?) the scrollbars which had spontaneously appeared.
- Factor out the grid machinery into a separate package, `vitessce-grid`.
- More information on the Welcome page, so changed it to a two-column layout.

## [0.0.14](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vitessce/v/0.0.14) - 2019-04-29
### Added
- Add Cypress.io tests.

- Add Google Analytics to all pages.
- "Please wait" now waits for all layers.
- Use [react-grid-layout](https://github.com/STRML/react-grid-layout) for draggable panes;
Layouts can be specified either responsively, or with fixed grid positions. Grid height is
based on window height at load.
- Script (`push-demo.sh`) to push demo to S3, without making a new release.
- Use [OpenSeadragon](http://openseadragon.github.io/) for tiled imagery.
### Changed
- Spatial viewport is part of the initial FAKE_API_RESPONSE, instead of being hardcoded.
- Neighborhoods are enabled, but hidden by default.

### Changed

- Borders on heatmap components... but this will be reverted.
- Cells are visible on initial load.
### Changed

### Changed
- Spatial and t-SNE backgrounds are now black.
- Move the Factor radio buttons to their own component, above Genes.

## [0.0.9](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vitessce/v/0.0.9) - 2019-03-17
